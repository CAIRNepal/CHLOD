  comments:
    - prefix.cc is quite a messy source, it has many outdated expansions for OBO ontologies, lots of strange duplicates etc
    - we recommend this is not used in isolation but is instead combined, lower in the priority order

  comments:
    - The correct form for most databases such as MGI, ZFIN, GO, CGD, COG, EC, ENSEMBL, etc is upper-case
    - the need for this will disappear if we can curated a preferred form in bioregistry
