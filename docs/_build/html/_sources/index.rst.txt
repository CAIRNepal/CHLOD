HeritageGraph Documentation
===========================

Welcome to the official documentation for **HeritageGraph**, Nepal's first Cultural Heritage Platform! Our goal is to preserve and share the rich cultural heritage of Nepal through innovative digital solutions. With **HeritageGraph**, we are digitizing cultural heritage data using Knowledge Graphs (KGs), making it more accessible, sustainable, and ready for the digital age.

What is HeritageGraph?
----------------------

**HeritageGraph** is a platform that creates a digital representation of Nepal’s cultural heritage. By converting physical artifacts, documents, and traditions into digital formats, we are ensuring their preservation, accessibility, and future relevance. In today’s world, digitalization is key to safeguarding cultural heritage from physical decay and loss. It also opens up new avenues for education, research, and cross-cultural exchange, making heritage more accessible to everyone.

Cultural heritage holds the memories, stories, and wisdom of humanity. By preserving it digitally, we not only protect our shared past but also ensure that future generations can reconnect with it and gain new insights. **HeritageGraph** helps us to achieve this by using Knowledge Graphs.

Why Digitalize Cultural Heritage?
----------------------------------

Digitalizing cultural heritage is essential for a number of reasons:

- **Preservation**: Protecting valuable cultural artifacts and traditions from physical degradation and loss.
- **Accessibility**: Making cultural heritage accessible to a wider audience, from students to researchers.
- **Education**: Enabling better learning and understanding of cultural histories.
- **Research**: Allowing interdisciplinary collaboration to gain new insights into our past.
- **Innovation**: Providing opportunities for new ways to study and present heritage.

By digitizing cultural heritage, we are creating a connection between the past, present, and future, ensuring that our shared legacy is never forgotten and remains available for future generations.

About the Project
-----------------

In this project, we focus on building a machine-readable, yet human-understandable, knowledge graph of Nepalese cultural heritage. By doing so, we aim to give people new ways to interact with, learn from, and explore the wealth of cultural knowledge Nepal has to offer.
