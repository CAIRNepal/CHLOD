Overview of Knowledge Graphs
============================

A **Knowledge Graph (KG)** is a structured representation of data where entities (such as people, places, things, or events) are connected by relationships. These graphs represent complex information in a way that is both machine-readable and understandable by humans.

In **HeritageGraph**, we use Knowledge Graphs to represent the intricate relationships within Nepalese cultural heritage, such as historical events, locations, and individuals.
